        <p>From 2022 to 2024 I attended the University of Surrey to complete a Master's Degree, now back in person I found <br>

        <h3>BSc Business Management (Marketing)</h3>
        <p> From 2018 to 2021 I called Guildford and the University of Surrey home while embarking on my <br> 
            bachelors degree. Through three years and a pandemic I completed a range of modules with focus varying from organisational <br> 
            behaviour and human resource management, accounting and finance, sustainability and innovation through to marketing. <br>
            During my time at Surrey I saw a transformation in my personal, academic and professional life, leaving with life long friends <br>
            from across the country and world, skills and knowledge I couldn't have dreamt of before, and a new understanding <br> 
            of the professional world. Listed below are some of the modules completed during this time. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Business Decision Making</li>
